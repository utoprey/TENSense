# TENSense
The TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) reasearch aims to investigate the effects of varying the characteristics of stimulating pulses on the sensations triggered in the median nerve. In addition, the project will explore how the type of stimulation (sound or electric) affects the time it takes for the subject to determine the shape of objects.

Hypothesis 1:
The first hypothesis of the TENS project suggests that the characteristics of stimulating pulses, such as width, frequency, and duration, play a significant role in the intensity and naturalness of the sensations triggered. The hypothesis proposes that low-frequency stimulation is more likely to trigger natural and less intense sensations, while high-frequency stimulation may lead to less natural and more intense sensations.

Experiment 1 Procedure (Median Nerve):
The experiment involves finding the median nerve and connecting the stimulation to it. Then, the width, frequency, and duration of the stimulating pulses will be varied, and the subjects will describe the sensations triggered on the description cards. Finally, the data collected will be analyzed to determine the relationship between the characteristics of the stimulating pulses and the sensations triggered in the median nerve. 

All notebooks can be found in Experiment_1 folder. Here is also required to use PercepMapper to collect patient's stimulus response.

Hypothesis 2:
The second hypothesis suggests that the type of stimulation used - sound or electric - affects the time required by the subject to determine the shape of objects. The hypothesis proposes that the optimal amplitude parameters and the same frequency and pulse width should be set for both types of stimulation to ensure a fair comparison.

Experiment 2 Procedure (Radial Nerve):
The experiment involves finding the radial nerve and connecting the stimulation to it. Apply comfortable amplitude for stimulation for emplementing drawning tasks. Collect the response in form of real pictures and the patient's understanding of forms by writting dowh their response.

Parameters of notebook in Experiment_2 folder: 1 kHz for sound, 4 shapes for figures
